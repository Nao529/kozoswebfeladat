                                The ender dragon is a giant flying hostile boss mob found when first entering the End. It is the largest naturally spawning mob in the game. Defeating it activates the exit portal that allows return to the Overworld and spawns end gateways that provide entry to the outer end islands. Its attacks involve charging at the player and hurling its acidic breath at them.

                                An enderman is a tall neutral mob found in all three dimensions. It becomes hostile to players that damage it or look directly at its face, using its arms to attack. Endermen teleport erratically, as well as away from dangers such as lava, projectiles, and water. They also occasionally pick up and move certain blocks.

                                A shulker is a box-shaped hostile mob found in end cities. It hides in its shell to protect itself and blend in with its surroundings, and attacks by shooting homing bullets that inflict Levitation. It is the only source of shulker shells, which are used to craft shulker boxes.

                    All players begin their exploration of the End with the main island. Unlike nether portals, entering the end portal instantly teleports the player to the End, giving no time to back out. Upon arrival in the End, the player is placed on a 5×5×1 obsidian platform with 3 layers of air blocks above it, if there are any blocks in a 3 block space above the platform, they are destroyed upon a player entering an end portal. The platform can generate on the island, within it, or at a short distance from it, close enough to throw an ender pearl to reach the island. It always generates centered on the coordinates (100, 49, 0) with the player facing west.

                    Once the player enters the End, the only way back is to die or defeat the ender dragon. The dragon spawns naturally and flies around above ten towers of obsidian arranged in a circle around the central exit portal, which fills up at the end of the battle. On top of each tower lies an end crystal, some of which are protected by cages of iron bars. These crystals heal the dragon, but can be destroyed by hitting it (even with projectiles). Destroying the crystal while the dragon is healing damages the dragon.

                    Once defeated, the dragon goes to the exit portal at (0, 64, 0), rises into the sky and disintegrates, with bright beams of light flashing from its body. It then explodes, drops 12,000 (first dragon) or 500 (all subsequent dragons) experience orbs, activates the exit portal, and generates one end gateway (first 20 dragons only). This gives the player access to the End's outer islands. Atop the exit portal lies four torches and the dragon egg. After killing the dragon, it can be respawned an unlimited number of times by placing four end crystals on the sides of the exit portal. Respawning the ender dragon regenerates any obsidian pillar blocks previously mined by the player, as well as the torches on the exit portal. However, the dragon egg does not regenerate upon killing a respawned ender dragon. 
                
                    Once the player enters the exit portal, the "end poem" is displayed, therefore "completing" the game. The player then respawns wherever their spawn is set in the Overworld or in the Nether, and may return to the End through the same portal (or a different portal from another stronghold); the End remains in the same state as the player left it. The obsidian platform is regenerated each time a player enters the End, meaning that any blocks or block entities placed in the 5×5×4 space on or above the platform are destroyed and replaced with obsidian and air blocks.

                <p>
                    The End is a dark, space-like dimension consisting of separate islands in the void, made out of end stone. It is inhabited by endermen and shulkers. The ender dragon also spawns when the player first arrives. The End is the final goal of Minecraft. The ender dragon is considered the final boss, and it is necessary to defeat it to "beat" the game and see the end poem.
